  <h1>Crime Heatmap</h1>
	<p> Using the crime heatmap is is easy to visualize the levels of crime during specific times of the days in the week. Using this map as a visualization, it is clear to see that during certain times of the week such as Friday night a large amount of crime takes place. It can also be seen that Thursday morning has very little crime. </p>

  <h1>Train Schedule</h1>
  <p> Using this visualization it is easy to see the time that a train takes to move from station to station. Hovering over a given train line offers more information about that given line. When hovering, the train highlights its path, marks the times of station stops via vertical lines and a tooltip pops up which outlines the entire train path by showing the stations and the times that they are stopped at.</p>
