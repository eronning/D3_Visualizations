I believe that everything is completed for both portions of the project. 

Design related:

In train times I used a external library called d3.tip for my tooltips, 
which made creating a tooltip easier. 
My tooltips are placed above the top of the path that is being selected.
This is so that it is easier to see the path than just having the tip next
to the mouse. 

In train times I added the 1 hour tick marks and not the 10 minute 
tick marks. This is because the 10 minute tick marks make the graph
much more cluttered and appear unnecessary. The pop up already shows
the exact time for each station. Hovering over a train line line draws
vertical lines marking times for each stop the train makes.
